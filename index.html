                    <b>Claim:</b> "Reading regularly improves vocabulary."<br><br>
                    <b>Paragraph 1 (Weaker Evidence):</b><br>
                    One piece of weaker evidence for the claim that reading improves vocabulary comes from personal experiences. Many people report that when they read frequently, they feel that their vocabulary grows as they encounter new words. Although this type of anecdotal evidence can be compelling, it lacks scientific backing and may only reflect individual experiences, making it less reliable in proving the claim universally.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Paragraph 2 (Stronger Evidence):</b><br>
                    A stronger piece of evidence supporting the benefits of reading on vocabulary is the opinion of educators and language experts, who generally agree that reading can help expand vocabulary. Experts believe that exposure to a wide range of words through books and articles enhances word knowledge. However, without specific studies or quantifiable data, this expert opinion remains less convincing than empirical research.

                    <br><br><b>Paragraph 3 (Strongest Evidence):</b><br>
                    The strongest evidence comes from a study published in the Journal of Educational Psychology, which found that students who read for at least 30 minutes daily scored 25% higher in vocabulary assessments than those who did not. This study’s findings are based on controlled research and statistical analysis, lending significant credibility to the claim. Because it includes specific data and is published in a reputable journal, this evidence is much more persuasive.

                    <br><br><b>Final Evaluation:                    </b><br>
                    Evaluating these types of evidence shows that the strongest evidence, which includes credible research with specific findings, is the most effective in supporting the claim. While weaker evidence based on personal anecdotes may be relatable, it lacks the reliability that scientific studies provide. Relying solely on weaker evidence would make the argument seem subjective and less convincing, whereas the strongest evidence offers concrete support, making the claim far more credible and persuasive.

                    <p><b>Prompt</b><br>“Should schools implement stricter regulations on the use of smartphones during class?”
                    <br><br><b>Claim:</b><br>Stricter regulations on smartphone use in class should be implemented because it minimises distractions and enhances focus. Studies have shown that students who are restricted from using smartphones during lessons demonstrate better engagement and higher academic achievement. Limiting phone use also fosters stronger interpersonal interactions, encouraging students to collaborate and communicate effectively with peers.
                    <br><br><b>Counterclaim:</b><br>Critics argue that smartphones are valuable learning tools, providing instant access to educational apps, research materials, and collaborative platforms. Banning them entirely might hinder students from utilising these resources to enhance their understanding of complex subjects.
                    <br><br><b>Conclusion:</b><br>While smartphones can be beneficial in certain contexts, the negative impact of their misuse on concentration and productivity supports the need for stricter regulations. By implementing clear policies, schools can strike a balance between leveraging technology for learning and maintaining an environment conducive to academic success.</p>
